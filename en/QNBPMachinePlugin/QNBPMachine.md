# Introduction of Yunkangbao sphygmomanometer

#### About the Equipment:
  Yunkangbao intelligent sphygmomanometer is a kind of intelligent sphygmomanometer device with Bluetooth WIFI dual-mode communication function.
  The measurement time of the device is within 30 seconds. The measurement data of two groups of users can be stored. Each group can store 99 measurement data. On the device, the user can view the average of the last three measurements and whether there is any arrhythmia. It can be used about 352 times on a full charge.
  There are 6 levels of volume. 5 is the maximum volume. When the volume level is 0, the voice will be turned off.
  The device time will be automatically synchronized when connected to Bluetooth, or can be set manually.

#### About blood pressure standards:
  The blood pressure standard in the device is set according to the family blood pressure judgment range in the 2018 Revision of Chinese Guidelines for Hypertension Prevention and Treatment, and cannot be modified. However, users can determine the appropriate range of judgment based on specific usage scenarios.
  Systolic blood pressure ≥135 or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 during home measurements is considered hypertension. When measured in the office, systolic blood pressure ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 is considered hypertension.

#### Bluetooth and WIFI features:
  Users can obtain the measurement data and history data of the sphygmomanometer through Bluetooth function, and can also obtain the measurement data of the sphygmomanometer remotely when connected to WIFI.
  The sphygmomanometer can carry out Bluetooth data transmission and WIFI network distribution operation when the button of "History" is pressed or the screen is lit up after a measurement is completed. WIFI data transfer takes place after the measurement is completed.
  Same as Bluetooth WIFI dual-mode scale, sphygmomanometer needs to connect with SDK in addition to Bluetooth function, and also needs to cooperate with server integration Docker.
